# AgentProbe Development Tasks

## Task Management Style Guide

### Priority Levels
- 🔴 **P0 (Critical)**: Must be done immediately, blocks other work
- 🟠 **P1 (High)**: Important features, should be next in queue  
- 🟡 **P2 (Medium)**: Nice to have, implement when P0/P1 done
- 🟢 **P3 (Low)**: Future enhancements, not urgent

### Task Format
```
- [ ] [P#] Task description (Assignee: @name) [Status: Not Started/In Progress/Done]
  - [ ] Subtask 1
  - [ ] Subtask 2
```

### Status Tracking
- **Not Started**: Task hasn't begun
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **Blocked**: Waiting on dependencies
- **Review**: Implementation complete, needs review
- **Done**: Fully complete and tested

### Completion Tracking
- Mark tasks with `[x]` when complete
- Add completion date: `[Done: 2025-01-20]`
- Strike through entire line when archived: `~~- [x] [P1] Completed task~~`

## Technical Decisions

### Database Choice: SQLite
- Embedded, no server needed
- Perfect for local development
- Easy to backup/share
- Can migrate to PostgreSQL later if needed

### Report Formats Priority
1. Markdown (easiest, git-friendly)
2. JSON (programmatic use)
3. HTML (visual reports)
4. CSV (data analysis)

### Analysis Focus
- Start with simple pattern matching
- Add ML-based analysis later
- Keep analysis pluggable

## Notes
- Each feature should include unit tests
- Update README.md as features are added
- Maintain backwards compatibility
- Consider performance for large result sets
- Keep storage format versioned for migrations
